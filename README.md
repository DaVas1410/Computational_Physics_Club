# Computational Physics Club

Welcome to the **Computational Physics Club**! This repository serves as the hub for our activities, projects, and resources related to computational physics using **Python** and **Mathematica**.

## 🚀 About the Club
We are a group of students and researchers passionate about using computational tools to solve complex physics problems. Our mission is to explore the intersection of programming, mathematics, and physics to gain deeper insights into the physical world.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Develop and share computational physics projects.
- Host **biweekly meetings** to discuss topics, tutorials, and challenges.
- Organize **coding hackathons** focused on physics and interdisciplinary collaboration.
- Provide learning resources for students at all levels.

## 🏆 Hackathon 2025
We are hosting a **Computational Physics Hackathon** on **May 16, 2025**. The event will feature:
- **Three difficulty levels** (beginner, intermediate, advanced).
- **Competitions in Python and Mathematica**.
- **Judging based on:**
  - Clean code 🧼
  - Academic integrity 📚
  - Creativity & innovation 💡
  - Computational efficiency ⚡
- A **4-member jury** consisting of physics and computer science professors and club representatives.
